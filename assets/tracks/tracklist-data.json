      "description": "This is the story of Zycerak. When Zycerak was little, he played a lot of Free Rider HD online. As he grew older, he got really fat and lazy and ugly. He has no job, lives with his parents, has no life, no friends, and every one hates him and calls him names. This is what happens when you play FRHD!",
